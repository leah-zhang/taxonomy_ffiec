# Introduction 

The “Management” booklet is one of 11 booklets that make up the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Information Technology Examination Handbook (IT Handbook). The “Management” booklet rescinds and replaces the June 2004 version. This booklet provides guidance to examiners and outlines the principles of overall governance and, more specifically, IT governance. Additionally, this booklet explains how risk management is a component of governance and how IT risk management (ITRM) is a component of risk management. This booklet describes the interaction of these components. The examination procedures in this booklet assist examiners in evaluating the following: 

* • IT governance as part of overall governance in financial institutions.
* • Processes for ITRM as part of risk management in financial institutions.1

IT supports most aspects of a financial institution’s business; therefore, effective ITRM is not limited to technology. The IT department typically manages back-office operations, network administration, and systems development and acquisition, and is involved in business continuity and resilience, and third-party management. IT management provides expertise in choosing and operating technology solutions for an institution’s lines of business (e.g., commercial credit and asset management) or for enterprise-wide activities (e.g., security and business continuity planning). 

IT management is critical to the performance and success of a financial institution. ITRM involves more than containing costs and controlling operational risks and does not work in isolation. A financial institution capable of aligning its IT infrastructure to support its business strategy adds value to the institution and positions itself for sustained success. Financial institutions face many challenges in today’s marketplace, including cybersecurity threats, increasing the need for effective IT management and ITRM. 

An institution’s IT systems may connect with affiliates, customers, internal lines of business, third parties (e.g., third-party providers2), and the public. IT creates interdependencies among infrastructure, applications, and Web content. These interdependencies affect the decision- making process necessary to support existing products and services and provide for the delivery of new products and services. Timely, accurate, and secure information is critical to meeting business requirements throughout the institution. Technology evolves rapidly, requiring enhancements to existing systems and prompting new investment in infrastructure, systems, and applications. New technology requires expertise, which creates competition for the necessary talent, knowledge, and skill sets. ITRM includes addressing new sources of risk that arise with new or evolving technology. 

1 The term “financial institution” includes national banks, federal savings associations, state savings associations, state member banks, state nonmember banks, and credit unions, as well as technology service providers that provide services to such entities. The term is used interchangeably with “institution” in this booklet. This booklet may refer to technology service providers specifically in cases where the agencies do not mean to include financial institutions. 

2 Third-party providers, also called third-party service providers, include technology service providers or other third parties that perform critical business activities for or on behalf of an institution. 

# I Governance 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution boards of directors should oversee, while senior management should implement, a governance structure that includes the following: 

* • Effective IT governance.
* • Appropriate oversight of IT activities.
* • Comprehensive IT management, including the various roles played by management.
* • Effective enterprise architecture.

Governance refers to how financial institutions manage and control their institution. Governance provides the structure through which an institution sets and pursues objectives while taking into account the regulatory and market environment and culture of the institution. The governance structure specifies the responsibilities for the board of directors, managers, auditors, and other stakeholders and specifies the level of authority and accountability for decision making. Governance also includes mechanisms for monitoring actions and decisions enterprise-wide. 

### I.A IT Governance 

IT governance is “an integral part of governance and consists of the leadership and organizational structures and processes that ensure that the organization’s IT sustains and extends the organization’s strategies and objectives.”3 IT governance objectives are to ensure that IT generates business value for the institution and to mitigate the risks posed by using technology. 

#### I.A.1 Board of Directors Oversight 

The board of directors sets the tone and direction for an institution’s use of IT. The board should approve the IT strategic plan, information security program, and other IT-related policies. To carry out their responsibilities, board members should understand IT activities and risks. The board or a board committee should perform the following: 

* • Review and approve an IT strategic plan that aligns with the overall business strategy and includes an information security strategy to protect the institution from ongoing and emerging threats, including those related to cybersecurity. 3 Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd edition, IT Governance Institute, 2003.
* • Promote effective IT governance.
* • Oversee processes for approving the institution’s third-party providers, including the third parties’ financial condition, business resilience, and IT security posture.
* • Oversee and receive updates on major IT projects, IT budgets, IT priorities, and overall IT performance. The board of directors may need to approve critical projects and activities, such as expanding the institution’s product line to include mobile financial services.
* • Oversee the adequacy and allocation of IT resources for funding and personnel.
* • Approve policies to escalate and report significant security incidents to the board of directors, steering committee, government agencies, and law enforcement, as appropriate.
* • Hold management accountable for identifying, measuring, and mitigating IT risks.
* • Provide for independent, comprehensive, and effective audit coverage of IT controls.

The board may delegate the design, implementation, and monitoring of specific IT activities to management or a committee (e.g., IT steering committee). An IT steering committee4 generally comprises senior management and staff from the IT department and other business units. Committee members do not have to be department heads, but members should understand IT policies, standards, and procedures (collectively, policies5). Each member should have the authority to make and be held accountable for decisions within their respective business units. If the institution has a formal risk management function, risk management staff should participate in an advisory capacity. 

The steering committee typically is responsible for reporting to the board on the status of IT activities. The reports enable the board to make decisions without having to be involved in routine activities. While the board may delegate the design, implementation, and monitoring of certain IT activities to the steering committee, the board remains responsible for overseeing IT activities and should provide a credible challenge6 to management. The steering committee is typically responsible for strategic IT planning, oversight of IT performance, and aligning IT with business needs. The steering committee should have a charter that defines its responsibilities. 

The steering committee should receive appropriate information from IT, lines of business, and external sources. Additionally, it should coordinate and monitor the institution’s IT resources. The steering committee should review and determine the adequacy of the institution’s training, including cybersecurity training, for staff. The steering committee should also document meeting minutes and decisions and inform the board of directors of the committee’s activities. 

4 In smaller or less complex financial institutions that may not have steering committees, these functions would be performed by management, IT department personnel, the board, or a board committee. 

5 For the purposes of this booklet, policies generally include policies, standards, and procedures, unless stated otherwise. When the booklet refers to policies and practices, it is the combination of the formal and approved policies, standards, and procedures and the actual practices in place. 

6 A credible challenge involves being actively engaged, asking thoughtful questions, and exercising independent judgment. 

#### I.A.2 IT Management 

IT management is responsible for IT performance and administering the day-to-day operation of an institution. IT management should perform the following: 

* • Implement IT governance.
* • Implement effective processes for ITRM, including those that relate to cybersecurity.
* • Review and annually approve processes for ITRM.
* • Assess the institution’s inherent IT risks across the institution.
* • Provide regular reports to the board on IT risks, IT strategies, and IT changes.
* • Establish and coordinate priorities between the IT department and lines of business.
* • Establish a formal process to obtain, analyze, and respond to information on threats and
* • Ensure that hiring and training practices are governed by appropriate policies to maintain vulnerabilities7 by developing a repeatable threat intelligence and collaboration program.8 competent and trained staff.
#### I.A.2(a) Executive Management 

Executive management, including the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief operating officer (COO), and often the chief information officer (CIO), plays a significant role in IT management at a financial institution. Executive management develops the strategic plans and objectives for the institution and sets the budget for resources to achieve these objectives. To carry out its responsibilities, executive management should understand at a high level the IT risks faced by the institution and ensure that those risks are included in the institution’s risk assessments. In the event that executive management is unable to implement an objective or agree on a course of action, executive management should escalate that matter to the board for more guidance. 

##### I.A.2(b) Chief Information Officer or Chief Technology Officer 

The CIO or chief technology officer (CTO) is responsible and should be held accountable for the development and implementation of the IT strategy to support the institution’s business strategy in line with its risk appetite. In less complex institutions, the IT manager may take on these responsibilities. This position typically oversees the IT budget and maintains responsibility for performance management, IT acquisition oversight, professional development, and training. In addition, the CIO or CTO is responsible for implementing the IT architecture and participating in planning activities. The IT management reporting structure should enable this position to accomplish these activities and ensure accountability for security, business resilience, risk reporting, and alignment of IT with business needs. The CIO or CTO should play a key role in the strategic planning as well as supporting activities of peers in various lines of business. The position often has a leadership role on the steering committee. 

7 See the FFIEC’s “Cybersecurity Threat and Vulnerability Monitoring and Sharing Statement,” November 3, 2014. 

8 For example, a repeatable threat intelligence and collaboration program could include internal resources, such as audit reports and fraud detection tools, or external resources, such as information sharing networks like the Financial Services–Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) InfraGard. 

#### I.A.2(c) Chief Information Security Officer 

The chief information security officer (CISO) is responsible for overseeing and reporting on the management and mitigation of information security risks across the institution and should be held accountable for the results of this oversight and reporting. Often, the CISO is responsible for implementing an information security program satisfying the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards9 (Information Security Standards), which were issued pursuant to the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA). While in the past the office of the CISO was considered a technology function, the role has become a strategic and integral part of the business management team. The CISO should be an enterprise-wide risk manager rather than a production resource devoted to IT operations. 

To ensure independence, the CISO should report directly to the board, a board committee, or senior management and not IT operations management. While cost and benefit decisions will always need to be made, IT security decisions and funding should not be unduly influenced by operational ease or budgetary constraints. The reporting structure should demonstrate that the CISO has the appropriate authority to carry out the responsibilities of that position and should avoid conflicts of interest that could interfere with the ability of the CISO to make decisions in line with the board’s risk appetite. The institution’s size and complexity plays a role in the reporting structure. A smaller or less complex institution may have an information security officer perform the responsibilities of the CISO and report to senior management. A larger or more complex institution may have additional reporting lines for the CISO into other independent functions, such as risk management. 

The CISO is typically responsible for the following: 

* • Implementing the information security strategy and objectives, as approved by the board of
* • Engaging with management in the lines of business to understand new initiatives, providing
* • Working with management in the lines of business to understand the flows of information,
* • Monitoring emerging risks and implementing mitigations.
* • Informing the board, management, and staff of information security and cybersecurity risks
* • Championing security awareness and training programs. directors, including strategies to monitor and address current and emerging risks. information on the inherent information security risk of these activities, and outlining ways to mitigate the risks. the risks to that information, and the best ways to protect the information. and the role of staff in protecting information. 9 12 CFR 30, appendix B (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)); 12 CFR 208, appendix D-2 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System); 12 CFR 364, appendix B (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)); and 12 CFR 748, appendix A (National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)). Refer to appendix C of this booklet for a listing of laws, regulations, and agency guidance.
* • Participating in industry collaborative efforts to monitor, share, and discuss emerging
* • Reporting significant security events to the board, steering committee, government agencies, security threats. and law enforcement, as appropriate.
#### I.A.2(d) IT Line Management 

IT line managers supervise the resources and activities of a specific IT function, department, or subsidiary. They typically coordinate services between the data processing area and other departments. They report to senior IT management on the plans, projects, and performance of their specific systems or departments. Some IT functions that often rely on line managers include data center operations, network services, application development, systems administration, telecommunications, customer support, and disaster recovery. Frontline managers coordinate daily activities, monitor current production, ensure adherence to established schedules, and enforce appropriate policies and controls in their areas. 

#### I.A.2(e) Business Unit Management 

Managers in an institution’s lines of business or business units also have IT responsibilities. Examples of these responsibilities include the following: 

* • Establishing processes for ongoing communication of business needs, information systems reporting needs, and product development plans to IT support or line management.
* • Ensuring that IT development efforts are prioritized, funded, and aligned with business strategy in the business unit.
* • Establishing processes to test compliance with IT-related control policies in the business unit.
* • Ensuring that required backup IT resources are available.
* • Documenting information flows throughout the business unit and notifying the CISO when business processes change.
* • Performing due diligence reviews for prospective third-party providers and ongoing monitoring of third-party providers with which the institution has established relationships.
* • Engaging with the CISO to discuss inherent information security risks of new business unit initiatives.

The specific technology roles in IT and business unit management may vary depending on the institution’s approach to risk management and policy enforcement. Institutions can approach technology management using either a centralized or a decentralized strategy. 

In a centralized IT environment, IT management typically acquires, installs, and maintains technology for the entire institution. IT management has a greater ability to control and monitor the institution’s technology investment. A centralized approach may promote greater operational efficiencies. The business unit managers retain the responsibility for enforcing internal controls within their areas. 

In a decentralized IT environment, IT management serves in an advisory role in some business units’ acquisition, installation, and maintenance of technology. The decentralized approach is more common in larger or more complex institutions, where IT management can expedite decisions on IT services by transferring decision-making authority to strategically significant departments. In this approach, business line management has a much greater responsibility for ensuring that technology investments are consistent with enterprise-wide strategic plans. Institutions should ensure system compatibility and enforcement of enterprise-wide policies in a decentralized environment. IT management should still have a role in defining the institution’s control requirements, but enforcement of enterprise-wide policies may be more difficult. 

#### I.A.3 Enterprise Architecture 

Enterprise architecture (EA) is the overall design and high-level plan that describes an institution’s operational framework and includes the institution’s mission, stakeholders, business and customers, work flow and processes, data processing, access, security, and availability. An EA program facilitates the conceptual design and maintenance of the network infrastructure, related IT controls, and policies. Management of financial institutions with highly complex systems or those experiencing growing IT costs without corresponding benefits should consider using or adjusting an EA program. As EA has evolved, different methodologies to implement EA programs have been developed. The underlying principle for all EA programs is that business IT requirements follow a predefined process that begins with a business need and ends with an IT solution that conforms to the policies approved by senior management and the board of directors. An effective EA program can result in the following: 

* • Enhanced interoperability from using IT to drive business adaptability.
* • Closer partnership between business and IT groups.
* • Improved focus on the institution’s goals.
* • Reduced numbers of failed IT systems.
* • Reduced complexity of IT systems.
* • Improved agility of IT systems.
* • Closer alignment between IT deliverables and business requirements.
* • Assurance that all software, including operating systems, is current and vendor supported.
* • Improved morale, as more staff members see a direct correlation between their work and the institution’s success.

Key considerations when developing an EA program include security, business resilience, data management, external connectivity, and alignment with the institution’s goals and objectives. To effectively implement an EA program, the institution should analyze the risks and potential impact of threats to all of the institution’s activities. A comprehensive EA program based on prudent practices can help an institution better develop processes to manage IT issues and identify, measure, and mitigate technology-based risks and threats. 

### I.B IT Responsibilities and Functions 

## Action Summary 

As part of the governance structure, financial institution management should ensure development, implementation, and maintenance of the following: 

* • An effective IT risk management structure.
* • A comprehensive information security program.
* • A formal project management process.
* • An enterprise-wide business continuity planning function.
* • An accurate and timely process for information systems reporting.

### I.B.1 IT Risk Management Structure 

The institution should have an adequate ITRM structure. Depending on the size and complexity of the financial institution, this structure can take different forms. In a large or complex institution, the ITRM function may be an independent business unit.10 In a small or less complex institution, ITRM may be integrated with functional areas, such as information security, business continuity planning, third-party management, and regulatory compliance. Internal audit, specifically IT audit, can provide independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management, but should not be responsible for its implementation. Regardless of the structure used, management should ensure that lines of authority are established for enforcing and monitoring controls. 

### I.B.2 Information Security 

The institution should have a comprehensive information security program that addresses all technology and information assets and that complies with the Information Security Standards; these standards and the GLBA are discussed in detail in the “Protecting Sensitive Customer Information” section of this booklet. The information security program should include appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards based on the inherent risk profile and the individual activities, products, and services of the institution. The board should delegate responsibility to the CISO or other appropriate personnel for assessing whether IT operations conform with policies. The CISO should ensure appropriate consideration of risks involved with new products, emerging technologies, and information systems. Testing of the controls identified in the information security program should be delegated to an independent auditor.11 

10 Some agencies have guidance on ITRM for larger, more complex financial institutions. 

11 An independent audit function can include internal auditors with sufficient independence to perform an adequate review, outside consultants or auditors, or a combination of both. 

The institution should separate information security program management and monitoring from the daily security duties of IT operations. The IT department should have personnel with daily responsibility for implementing the institution’s security policy. Responsibility for making changes and granting exceptions to policy should be segregated from the enforcement of the controls. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Information Security” booklet for more information. 

### I.B.3 Project Management 

An effective project management process is a key factor in a well-managed IT operation and includes applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to achieve project objectives. The operational complexity of the institution dictates the degree of formality of project management practices. Generally, project management consists of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and completing projects. The institution’s ability to manage projects drives its ability to adapt to changes in its business requirements and satisfy its strategic objectives. Management uses project management techniques to control projects for systems acquisition and development, systems conversions, product enhancements, infrastructure upgrades, and system maintenance. 

Project teams should balance resource investments of time, money, and expertise with a project’s priority, risk, and requirements. Management should monitor projects closely to control costs and assure adherence to project management policies. A formal project management system, if used, should employ well-defined and proven techniques for managing projects at all stages. Regardless of the system used, management should include the following elements in its project management process: 

* • Oversight by experienced and skilled project managers, whether they are employees of the institution or consultants hired for specific projects.
* • Accepted and standardized project management practices.
* • Senior management support, including a review process around significant projects.12
* • Defined and monitored institution-wide project risk assessment methodology.
* • Approval processes to ensure that projects are defined, go through a risk assessment process, and meet requirements.
* • Established project requirements with collaboration among stakeholders and project management staff for each phase of the project.
* • Target completion dates to track each task or phase of the project.
* • Timely project status updates to compare actual completion dates with target dates.
* • Procedures to track and measure project performance against requirements.
* • A defined change management process, including approval requirements.
* • Sufficient testing at all appropriate stages of the project to ensure that the new system or process will not negatively impact existing systems.
* • Training for end users and designated staff responsible for ongoing support.
* • A well-managed process for transition in ownership from implementation teams to operational teams. 12 The significance of projects will depend on the institution’s activities and its size and complexity.

Based on an institution’s size and complexity, an institution pursuing a more-than-moderate growth path should consider establishing a project management office to promote sound management practices and principles. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Development and Acquisition” booklet for more information. 

### I.B.4 Business Continuity 

Business continuity is defined as the ability to maintain operations and services, both technology and business, in the event of a disruption to normal operations and services. The board of directors should oversee implementation and approve policies relating to business continuity planning. Senior management should establish and implement policies, standards, and procedures and define responsibilities for enterprise-wide business continuity planning. Because business continuity is important for both business processes as well as technology operations, business continuity planning should be approached on an enterprise-wide basis. Business continuity planners should assess the ability for all lines of business to remain resilient or recover from disruptions or degradations. The business continuity function often resides in the risk management organizational structure. A specific member of management should be assigned responsibility for the oversight of the business continuity function, and both business and technology departments should assign personnel to develop and maintain the individual business unit plans. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Business Continuity Planning” booklet for more information. 

### I.B.5 Information Systems Reporting 

A variety of systems can provide management with the information necessary to manage an institution effectively. These systems are often referred to as management information systems, decision support systems, and risk control self-assessments, to name just a few. While the precise definitions vary, these information systems are used by management to assess the performance of the business, report on the risks and challenges it faces, and assist management in the successful operation of the business. 

Management should design its information systems to do the following: 

* • Provide management with information that is timely, accurate, consistent, complete, and relevant.
* • Provide an objective system for recording and aggregating information.
* • Provide key risk performance trends and indicators; and measure performance against risk tolerances.
* • Support the institution’s strategic plan.
* • Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
* • Reduce labor-intensive manual activities.
* • Enhance communication among staff.

Information systems reporting supplies decision makers with facts, supports and enhances the overall decision-making process, and can improve job performance throughout an institution. At the most senior levels, information systems reporting provides the data and information to help the board and management make strategic decisions. At other levels, information systems reporting allows management to monitor the institution’s activities and distribute information to staff, customers, and members of management. 

Advances in technology have increased the volume of data and information available to management and directors for planning and decision making. Because report generation systems can rely on manual data entry or extract data from many different financial and transaction systems, management should establish appropriate control procedures to ensure that data and information are correct and relevant. Because information systems reporting can originate from multiple technology platforms, the controls should be designed to maintain the integrity of the information and the processing environment. 

To function effectively as a feedback tool for management and staff, information systems reporting should meet five essential elements: 

#### • Timeliness: 

To facilitate prompt decision making, an institution’s information systems should be capable of providing and distributing current information to appropriate management or staff. 

#### • Accuracy: 

A sound system of automated and manual internal controls should exist to ensure the validity of the information and should include appropriate editing, balancing, and internal control checks. 

#### • Consistency: 

To be reliable, data should be processed and compiled in a uniform manner. Variations in data collection and reporting methods can distort information and trend analysis. 

#### • Completeness: 

Reports should contain the necessary information to inform decision makers without voluminous detail. 

#### • Relevance: 

Information systems should provide current, applicable, and actionable information. 

In a complex institution, information systems reporting can be highly structured and automated. In a less complex institution, it can be informal and less dependent on sophisticated technology systems. Institution management should adopt information systems reporting capabilities commensurate with the size and complexity of the institution. 

### I.B.6 Planning IT Operations and Investment 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution boards should oversee, while senior management should implement, an IT planning process with the following elements: 

* • Long-term goals and the allocation of IT resources to achieve them, usually within a three- to five-year horizon.
* • Alignment of the IT strategic plan with the enterprise-wide business plan.
* • Identification and measurement of risk before changes or new investment in technology are made.
* • An IT infrastructure to support current and planned business operations.
* • Integration of IT spending into the budgeting process and weighing of direct and indirect benefits against the total cost of ownership of the technology.

Planning involves preparing for future activities by defining goals and the strategies used to achieve them. Future activities may include releasing a new product or service, planning mergers and acquisitions, or preparing for the end of service for an IT system. IT is an integral part of financial institution operations. Therefore, institution management should integrate consideration of IT resources and investments into the overall business planning process. Major investments in IT resources have long-term implications on both the delivery and performance of an institution’s products and services. 

Plans may vary significantly depending on institutions’ size and structure. Management should strive to achieve a planning process that constantly adjusts for new risks or opportunities and maximizes IT’s value. Management should document its plan; a written plan, however, does not guarantee an effective planning process. Management should measure the effectiveness of a specific plan by whether the plan meets the institution’s business needs. A sound plan should involve the board of directors, senior management, and staff in the planning process. The board of directors should provide a credible challenge to management when the board reviews and approves the plan. Senior management participates in formulating and implementing the plan. The individual departments and functional areas identify specific business needs and, ultimately, implement the plan. 

An institution that uses third-party providers should verify that the provider can continue to support the institution’s plans and that the plans and actions of the provider do not negatively impact the institution. As part of the institution’s ongoing monitoring process, management should participate in third-party provider client user groups. Institution management should also consider a review of client portals, news articles, provider newsletters, and press releases to maintain awareness of provider activities, changes in strategy and products, future plans, and potential or actual service or security issues. 

### I.B.6(a) Strategic IT Planning 

Strategic IT planning should address long-term goals and the allocation of IT resources to achieve them. Strategic IT planning focuses on a three- to five-year horizon and helps ensure that the institution’s technology plans are consistent and aligned with the institution’s business plan. Effective strategic IT planning can ensure delivery of IT services that balance cost and efficiency, while enabling the business units to meet the competitive demands of the marketplace. The IT strategic plan should address the budget, periodic board reporting, and the status of risk management controls. 

Tactical plans support the larger IT strategic plan by defining specific steps necessary to fulfill it. Tactical plans outline specific steps, personnel, tools, and timetables to achieve the goals laid out in the IT strategic plan, typically using a one-year time frame. These tactical plans typically address hardware and software architecture, end-user computing resources, and processing done by third-party providers. These plans are often created by mid-level managers. 

The operational IT plan is used to achieve the goals and objectives of both the tactical plans and the larger strategic plan. It provides the detailed information to perform the tasks needed to implement the tactical plans of an institution. The operational IT plan includes the milestones and tasks that must be undertaken, the individuals who have responsibility for each milestone and task, the timelines in which they must be completed, the conditions for success, and the financial resources necessary to complete each milestone and task. Operational plans should flow logically from both the tactical plans and the larger IT strategic plan. Front-line management typically creates and revises operational plans as needed based on changes in the underlying business needs. 

Strategic IT planning should consider a number of factors: 

* • Marketplace conditions.
* • Customer demographics.
* • Institution growth targets.
* • Mergers and acquisitions.
* • Technology standards.
* • Regulatory requirements (e.g., privacy, security, consumer disclosures, and other reporting requirements).
* • Cost containment.
* • Process improvement and efficiency gains.
* • Customer service and technology performance quality.
* • Third-party relationship opportunities versus in-house expertise.
* • Optimal infrastructure, including systems and software replacement.
* • Ability to adopt and integrate new technology.

These factors should align with the institution’s business plans. Well-implemented IT plans enable the institution to deliver business value in terms of market share, earnings, and capital growth. If used, the IT steering committee’s cross-functional membership makes the committee well-suited for balancing or aligning the institution’s IT investment with its strategic objectives. 

Typically, institutions that align IT with changing business goals and objectives have more effective operations. 

Technology expenditures should be commensurate with the financial condition of the institution. They should also be appropriate to meet the changing IT strategy, provide enterprise-wide value, support necessary growth, ensure appropriate security and business resilience, and mitigate technology incompatibilities. For example, delaying investments and spending too conservatively on infrastructure or new products may lead to ineffective operations and service levels. Without a full understanding of the available technology, the institution is not able to update processes and products or achieve productivity gains or increased revenues. To create the appropriate balance, institutions should link strategic and operational plans between IT and the business units. 

Management should address the following four key factors of IT planning: 

* • Senior management participation: Senior management should understand and support the IT strategic plan and established priorities.
* • Role of IT: Management should clarify the role of IT and determine whether the current IT planning process enables personnel to work toward achieving enterprise-wide goals and objectives.
* • Impact of IT infrastructure: Management or the IT steering committee should understand the relationship between the IT infrastructure and applications and the business strategic and operating plans. The IT infrastructure should directly support the goals and objectives of these plans.
* • Accurate scorecard on past performance: Management or the IT steering committee should monitor past IT projects and initiatives after implementation to determine whether the institution realized the anticipated costs and benefits. The scorecard should be based on a set of objective measures.

Management should also create and maintain an alignment between IT and enterprise-wide strategies by performing the following: 

* • Reviewing whether IT strategic plans are aligned with the business strategy.
* • Reviewing whether IT performance supports the planned strategy.
* • Ensuring that the IT department is delivering on time, within budget, and to specification.
* • Balancing investments between systems that support current operations and systems that transform operations and enable business units to grow and compete in new areas.
* • Focusing IT resource decisions on specific business objectives, such as entry into new markets, enhanced competitive position, revenue growth, improved customer satisfaction, or customer retention.
### I.B.6(b) IT Resources 

Management should provide IT resources that are adequate to meet the current operational needs of the institution. Operational planning should consider the impact of any changes on critical business processes. Business processes are the integration of people, technology, and procedures used to accomplish a task or complete a transaction. Changes in business processes should be coordinated and aligned with available IT resources. IT resources include the following elements: 

#### • Infrastructure: 

Power, telecommunications capacity, network architecture, and facilities. 

#### • Hardware: 

Mainframes, network servers, personal computers, communications networks, mobile devices, storage devices, and peripherals. 

#### • 

Operating software: Operating systems, compilers, and utilities designed to enable the equipment and applications software to function effectively, both internally and externally. 

#### • 

Application software: Programs designed to permit application users to perform a specific task or function. Application software runs on top of operating system software. 

#### • Personnel: 

Staff and training programs. 

Management should consider sufficient capacity for current and future needs for each of these elements. 

### I.B.6(c) Budgeting 

Budgeting is another step in the operational planning process. The board should assess management’s plans and its success in defining and meeting budgetary goals as one means of evaluating management’s performance. The budget is a coordinated financial plan used to estimate and control the institution’s activities. By assessing future economic developments and conditions, management creates an action plan and records changes in the balance sheet accounts and profitability (predicated on implementation of the plan). The budget not only projects expected results, but also serves as an important check on management. 

When considering new IT projects, management should look at the entry costs of the technology and the post-implementation support costs. Increasingly, institutions are demanding, and third- party providers are providing, information regarding the total cost of ownership (TCO) beyond initial entry costs. IT projects often have undocumented costs, including the resources required to configure, maintain, repair, support, upgrade, and manage the technology over its lifetime. Readily available TCO models, as well as historical data, provide management with tools to incorporate such costs into the selection and budgeting process. 

Some institutions budget IT as a separate department. A financial analysis of an IT department should include a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the in-house operation versus contracting with a third-party provider. The analysis may also include a peer group comparison of operating costs and ratios. Depending on its size and complexity, the institution may allocate costs to the institution’s lines of business. When cost allocation is used, management should ensure equitable assignment of the costs to each line of business. Equitable assignment of the costs is often accomplished by use of a chargeback system that records usage of resources based on a performance metric such as central processing unit cycles. 

In some instances, a separate subsidiary of the holding company manages the IT function. An IT subsidiary can provide essential services at costs below those of third-party providers or individual institutions. Some relationships, however, may not result in a cost savings. Any transaction between the institution and its affiliates must comply with applicable laws and regulations.13 Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Outsourcing Technology Services” booklet for more information. 

### I.B.7 Other Functions 

## Action Summary 

The IT function at a financial institution is influenced by several other functions, which should include the following: 

* • The human resources function should hire and maintain competent and motivated IT staff.
* • The IT audit function should validate appropriate controls to mitigate IT risk.
* • The compliance function should validate that systems and applications adhere to applicable laws and regulations.

### I.B.7(a) Human Resources 

Human resources (HR) supports the IT function’s ability to hire and maintain a competent and motivated staff. IT management should integrate its management of HR with IT planning to ensure optimum development and availability of IT skills. 

Components of an effective IT HR management process include compensation planning, performance reviews, knowledge transfer mechanisms (e.g., rotational assignments), training, and mentoring. The board should actively and effectively provide oversight of incentive compensation programs for IT management to ensure that the programs appropriately balance risk and reward and are compatible with effective controls and risk management. 

An institution should have programs in place to ensure that staff members have the expertise necessary to perform their jobs and achieve company goals and objectives. The institution may need to look externally to find necessary expertise for specialized areas. 

13 Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, codified at 12 USC 371c and 12 USC 371c-1, govern transactions between certain financial institutions, such as Federal Reserve member banks, national banks, and federal savings associations, and the institutions’ affiliates. Specifically, section 23B(a) states that an institution and its subsidiaries may engage in certain transactions with an affiliate, including the payment of money or the furnishing of services to an affiliate under contract, lease, or otherwise. The transactions must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of comparable transactions, the statute requires that such transactions be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, nonaffiliated companies. See 12 USC 371c-1(a). 

Management should develop training programs for new technology and products before their deployment in the institution. The institution may use its own certification program or encourage employees to obtain an external certification to ensure that the staff maintains the necessary expertise to support the business. 

The board and senior management should consider appropriate succession and transition strategies for key managers and staff members. Some strategies include the use of employment contracts, professional development plans, and contingency plans for interim staffing of key management positions. Management should have backup staff for key positions and should cross-train additional personnel. The objective is to provide for a smooth transition in the event of turnover in vital IT management or IT operations. 

### I.B.7(b) IT Audit 

The audit department should send IT audit reports to appropriate management and directly to the board of directors or a designated board committee. The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the IT auditors’ performance and compensation, including whether the IT auditors have the necessary expertise and the audit coverage is adequate, timely, and independent. Depending on the institution’s size and complexity, the board of directors may completely outsource the IT audit function. In those cases, the outsourced auditor should be engaged by the board or audit committee. 

IT auditors should validate that IT controls are designed appropriately to mitigate risk and are operating as management intended. IT audit should be completely independent, should have no role in designing or implementing controls, and should not have primary responsibility for enforcing policy. Management should have processes in place to monitor and enforce policy compliance. IT audit should verify that those processes function effectively and report the results to the board. 

Senior management should ensure cooperation between business unit management and IT audit. Management should also ensure timely and accurate response to audit concerns and exceptions and ensure appropriate and timely corrective action. 

Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Audit” booklet for more information. 

### I.B.7(c) Compliance 

Senior management should ensure that compliance staff reviews new products, systems, applications, or changes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. New implementations or changes can cause noncompliance through, for example, inaccurate interest rate calculations, inadequate or inaccurate disclosures, weak security controls over the creation, storage, or transmission of customer information, or poor customer verification procedures. 

# II Risk Management 

Financial institution management should understand and evaluate risk across the institution, including the definitions and categories of risk. Risk is the potential that events, expected or unanticipated, may have an adverse effect on a financial institution’s earnings, capital, or reputation. For regulatory purposes, risk is categorized as operational, liquidity, interest rate, credit, price, reputation, strategic, and compliance (legal). Although financial institution management should be aware of all potential risks as part of its overall risk management program, operational risk is the primary risk associated with IT. 

## II.A Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk of failure or loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, or systems. Operational risks from IT are present not only in back-office operations and transaction processing but also in areas such as customer service, systems development and support, internal controls and processes, and capacity planning. Operational risk may cross all lines of business and can be caused by internal or external events. Operational risk from IT primarily affects reputation, strategic, and compliance risks, although other risks may be affected. 

Management should be aware of the implications of operational risk from IT, including the following: 

* • Strategic risk can stem from inaccurate information or analysis that causes management to make poor IT strategic decisions.
* • Compliance risk can result from an institution’s inability to meet the regulatory and legal requirements associated with its products and services. Compliance risk can also result from an institution’s dependence on products and services to meet its operations and reporting requirements.
* • Reputation risk can stem from errors, delays, omissions, unauthorized access to IT systems, or loss of confidential information that become public knowledge. Such occurrences may directly affect business partners and customers and may result in a loss of customers, customer withdrawal of funds, and loss of trust in the institution’s products or services.

Management should have a comprehensive view of operations and business processes that are supported by technology. IT management should maintain an active role in institution strategic planning to align IT with established business goals and strategies. Additionally, management should ensure that effective IT controls exist throughout the institution, either through direct oversight or by holding lines of business accountable for IT-related controls. From a control standpoint, management should participate in the ITRM process to identify and measure risk from the use of IT, support decisions on how to mitigate the risks, implement the mitigation decisions, and monitor and report on the resulting outcomes. 

# III IT Risk Management 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution management should develop an effective ITRM process that supports the broader risk management process. As part of the ITRM process, management should perform the following: 

* • Identify risks to information and technology assets within the financial institution or controlled by third-party providers.
* • Measure the level of risk.
* • Mitigate the risks to an acceptable residual risk level in conformance with the board’s risk appetite.
* • Monitor changing risk levels and report the results of the process to the board and senior management.

The ITRM process supports the enterprise-wide risk management framework through four activities: (1) risk identification, (2) risk measurement, (3) risk mitigation, and (4) risk monitoring and reporting. Risk identification generally documents inventories of systems and information necessary to financial institution operations and defines the potential threats to the institution’s systems and operations. Risk measurement is a process of determining the likelihood of an adverse event or threat occurring and the potential impact of such an event on the institution. Risk mitigation includes the implementation of appropriate controls to reduce the potential for risk and bring the level of risk in line with the board’s risk appetite. Monitoring and reporting provide the board and senior management with regular updates demonstrating the effectiveness of the risk management process. 

Management should identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report IT risks that threaten the safety and soundness of an institution. An effective ITRM process is regularly updated and aligns IT and business objectives. This process should have a higher level of formality in more complex institutions. 

The ITRM process is not complete without consideration of the overall IT environment. Management may need to consider risks associated with IT environments from two different perspectives: 

* • A centralized IT environment supports lines of business across shared infrastructure.
* • A decentralized IT environment supports lines of business with separately managed infrastructure.

The following sections detail the processes involved in each of the ITRM activities. 

### III.A Risk Identification 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution management should maintain a risk identification process that is coordinated and consistent throughout the institution. Risk identification includes ongoing data collection from existing activities and new initiatives. 

All activities within a financial institution present a degree of risk. The nature of such risk, before applying controls and other mitigations, is called inherent risk. Senior management should ensure that IT risk identification efforts at the enterprise-wide level are coordinated and consistent throughout the institution. Management should maintain inventories of assets (e.g., hardware, software, and information), event classes (e.g., natural disaster, cyber, and insider abuse or compromise), threats (e.g., theft, malware, and social engineering), and existing controls as an important part of effective risk identification. Inventories should include systems and information hosted or maintained externally. Comprehensive IT risk identification should include identification of cybersecurity risks as well as details gathered during information security risk assessments required under guidelines implementing the GLBA.14 Participation in an information-sharing forum, such as FS–ISAC,15 should be a component of the risk identification process because sharing information may help the institution identify and evaluate relevant cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.16 

Senior management should make risk management decisions based on a full understanding of identified risks. Small institutions with less complex systems may have a more simplified risk identification process. Regardless of the complexity, the process should be formal and adapt to changes in the IT environment. The effectiveness of the risk identification process is demonstrated by management’s understanding and awareness of risk, the adequacy of formal risk assessments, and the effectiveness of the risk mitigation, including policies and internal controls. 

### III.A.1 Ongoing Data Collection 

Understanding an institution’s environment is the first step in any risk identification process. In identifying risks, management should collect and compile the following information regarding the institution’s IT environment: 

14 Refer to the “Information Security” booklet of the IT Handbook for more information on the GLBA and the “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards.” 

15 Refer to “FFIEC Releases Cybersecurity Assessment Observations, Recommends Participation in Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center,” November 3, 2014. 

16 Ibid. 

* • IT systems inventories: These are critical to understanding the institution’s IT infrastructure, as well as identifying the access and storage points for confidential customer and institution information.
* • IT strategic plan: Such a plan can provide insight into the institution’s planning process. Review and analysis of the strategic plan as part of the risk identification process may highlight developing risk exposures or other deficiencies that limit the institution’s ability to implement strategic priorities.
* • Interconnectivity:17 Management should comprehensively identify connections with third- party providers, including other financial institutions and financial institution intermediaries, because of the potential for significant operational risk through these interdependencies. In addition, management should identify all access points and connection types that pose risk, such as local or wide area network (LAN/WAN) connections to other networks or Internet service providers, cloud services, Wi-Fi, and cellular connections.
* • Information flow: Management should document the flows of information throughout the institution, including flows of sensitive customer information. This documentation is critical to understanding what information assets the institution owns, where they are stored and transmitted, and who has access to them.
* • Business continuity and disaster recovery plans: These plans prioritize the availability of various lines of business and often encompass restoration and provision of control and customer service and support. These plans can offer insight into the institution’s critical operations and control environment.
* • Third-party management program: Due diligence and monitoring present valuable information on the third-party provider’s control environment. This information is necessary to identify the risks in an institution’s IT environment.
* • Call center: Issue tracking reports can often indicate potential performance or control issues if the problem reports are aggregated and analyzed for repetitive or common issues.
* • Self-assessments: Assessments specifically on IT-related controls can provide early identification of policy noncompliance or weaknesses in controls.
* • IT audit findings: These findings provide insight into the effectiveness of internal controls and staff and management’s commitment to policy compliance.
* • Threat intelligence information: By working with industry forums and groups, institutions can obtain information about emerging threats and the ways other organizations manage those threats.

In the process of collecting and compiling this information, management should include the potential cybersecurity risks associated with these areas of the financial institution’s IT environment. 

17 This term refers to the connections between networks that are owned and operated by different entities. 

### III.B Risk Measurement 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution management should develop risk measurement processes that include the following elements: 

* • Measuring risk using qualitative, quantitative, or a hybrid of methods.
* • Recognizing that risks do not exist in isolation.
* • Prioritizing the risks based on the results of risk measurement.

Risk measurement typically is performed according to policies governing the enterprise-wide risk management process. Measurement is helpful in estimating the likelihood of an adverse event and its potential impact across the institution. Measurement across the financial institution is particularly important when an event impacts shared services and infrastructure or a shared customer base. 

Measurements may be qualitative, quantitative, or a hybrid of both. Qualitative measures rely on experience, judgment, and intuition and are subject to potential flaws due to bias and other factors. Types of qualitative assessments include questionnaires or surveys to measure risk. Quantitative measures, on the other hand, are based on numerical values, such as dollar amounts or number of systems out of compliance. Quantitative measurement methods may include top- down and all-encompassing measures as well as measures that are limited to discrete activities and management choices. Hybrid measurements are frequently used and typically combine qualitative and quantitative measures to provide a more comprehensive analytical approach. A hybrid assessment could include a survey of staff to gain individual insight combined with numerical data inputs. Important considerations when evaluating hybrid measures include those presented above for both qualitative and quantitative measures. 

Regardless of the method used, management should estimate the likelihood of occurrence and severity of the impact of the identified risk. When analyzing the potential impact, management should consider financial, reputation, or other impact to the institution. Organizational impacts are highly variable and not always easy to quantify. They include such considerations as lost revenue, data recovery and reconstruction expense, costs of litigation and potential judgments, loss of market share, and increases to premiums or denials of insurance coverage. 

There are a variety of techniques, including the use of applications, to measure risk. Applications to provide measurement-related information may be developed in-house, acquired, or both. IT’s role in development and acquisition should be consistent with the guidance in the IT Handbook’s “Development and Acquisition” booklet. 

The following are common types of risks that often have significant impact: 

* • Security breaches: Including internal and external breaches, weak program code used to perpetrate fraud, and computer viruses.
* • System failures: Including telecommunication failures, LAN and WAN failures, hardware and software failures, interconnectivity failures, and backup system failures.
* • External events: Including weather-related events, earthquakes, pandemics, terrorism, cyber attacks, cut utility lines (e.g., telecommunication, water, and power), or widespread power outages.
* • Insider events: Including intentional or unintentional acts by staff, such as carelessness, social engineering that results in inappropriate access or the installation of malware, and improper changes to transactions, systems, or databases.
* • Development and acquisition issues: Including strategic platform or supplier risk, inappropriate definition of business requirements, incompatibility with existing systems, inadequate project management, programming errors (internal or external), change management issues, failure to integrate and/or migrate systems or applications successfully, or obsolescence of software.
* • Capacity planning issues: Including inadequate capacity planning or inaccurate forecasts of growth.
* • Third-party provider issues: Including deficiencies in the oversight of third-party providers in areas such as reporting, breach notification, business continuity and resilience testing, and subcontracting (fourth-party) risk management.

The institution should recognize that no risk exists in isolation; there are interdependencies among risks. This reinforces the need for an integrated approach for risk management. To ensure accurate risk measurement, management should ensure that risk assessments are updated regularly, and as changes occur, to address new technologies, products, services, and connections before deployment. 

The IT department can have a specialized and unique role in the measurement and prioritization of IT-related threats, based on its expertise in the development, application, and use of IT. Institution management should use that expertise, as well as the expertise provided by others (e.g., auditors, third-party providers, and other third parties), in the risk measurement process. Once management identifies and measures the institution’s IT risk, it should rank the risks and prioritize its response. 

### III.C Risk Mitigation 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution management should implement effective control and risk transfer practices as part of its overall IT risk mitigation strategy. These practices should include the following: 

* • Establishing, implementing, and enforcing IT policies, standards, and procedures.
* • Documenting policies for hiring and training personnel.
* • Implementing internal controls for information security risks.
* • Establishing and implementing effective cybersecurity controls.
* • Developing and testing formal business continuity plans.
* • Establishing and implementing a well-managed and controlled software development and acquisition function.
* • Controlling, managing, and monitoring an IT operations function.
* • Reviewing insurance for IT operations, including cyber insurance.
* • Developing an effective third-party management program.

Risk mitigation is the process of reducing risks through the introduction of specific controls. Risk mitigation decisions are implemented through the use of controls or risk transfer. Risk transfer can be accomplished through mechanisms such as insurance. After implementing controls or transferring the risk, management should determine the level of residual risk, or the risk that cannot be fully mitigated or avoided. Both controls and risk transfer should be considered when evaluating whether a residual risk is within the financial institution’s risk appetite. Risk appetite is the amount of risk a financial institution is prepared to accept when trying to achieve its objectives. 

Controls are implemented in financial institution activities and may be performed either manually by staff or through automated systems. Controls can be classified by timing (preventive, detective, corrective) or nature (administrative, technical, physical). Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Information Security” booklet for more information. The IT department generally implements controls within the institution for assets that are under the IT department’s control. Non-IT-related controls implemented elsewhere in the financial institution should be coordinated with the IT department to ensure their adequacy. 

Controls should be evaluated for effectiveness against identified threats or vulnerabilities. Evaluation typically is accomplished by tools that supplement and complement assurance and audit activities. Two examples of tools used are control self-assessments and scenario analysis. Control self-assessments, used internally to assess the effectiveness of ITRM processes and related controls, typically are performed by departments or lines of business periodically testing and validating their controls. Scenario analysis is a process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative outcomes. It can be a valuable tool for gaining an overall understanding of the exposure to existing, expected, and plausible (including potentially severe) events, as well as the robustness of—or gaps in—controls or other risk mitigation. Additionally, a control self-assessment should encompass external requirements, such as laws, regulations, and widely accepted control standards and practices.18 Failure to comply with external requirements, whether in law, regulation, or contract, can result in compliance risk as well as strategic, reputation, or other risks. Conformance with widely accepted control standards and practices can demonstrate due care in the operation of IT and potentially reduce operational risk. 

Conformance with external requirements alone is not sufficient to ensure that the overall ITRM process is adequate. The ITRM process encompasses risk posed by the operation of the financial institution in its specific internal and external environment. Accordingly, the ITRM process should consider whether the IT control structure, when combined with controls outside the IT systems, adequately mitigates risk associated with the use of IT. 

### III.C.1 Policies, Standards, and Procedures 

In general, a policy is a governing principle that provides the basis for standards and is adopted by the board. The policy is an overall statement of the institution’s philosophy or intent. Standards are mandatory criteria that ensure conformity with policy, government regulations, and acceptable levels of control. Procedures are typically documents that describe, in detail, the behavior or processes used to adhere to the criteria mandated by standards. Clearly written and frequently communicated policies can establish clear assignments of duties, help staff coordinate and perform their tasks effectively and consistently, and aid in training staff. Senior management should ensure that policies, standards, and procedures are current, well documented, and integrated with the institution’s information security strategy. 

Institution management should create, document, maintain, and adhere to policies, standards, and procedures to manage and control the institution’s IT risk. The level of detail depends on the complexity of the IT environment but should enable management to monitor the identified risk posture. Review of adherence to documented policies, standards, and procedures may be performed internally, by a risk or compliance function in the institution, or through independent audit. This review often helps to identify problems early so they can be corrected before they become serious. 

### III.C.2 Personnel 

The institution should mitigate risks posed by IT staff by performing appropriate background checks and screening of new staff. The controls in this section also are relevant for third-party provider staff, consultants, and temporary personnel who support the IT function. Typically, the minimum verification considerations should include the following: 

18 Examples of widely accepted industry standards include National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications, the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) framework, and the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). 

* • Background checks, including confirmations of prior experience, academic credentials,
* • Confirmation of identity from government-issued identification.
* • Character references. professional qualifications, or criminal records.19

The institution should use job descriptions, employment agreements (usually for higher-level or higher-sensitivity positions), training, and awareness programs to promote understanding and increase individual accountability. The job descriptions should detail duties and responsibilities and be routinely updated by managers responsible for the positions with assistance from HR. Management should document and confirm access privileges for each staff member based on his or her job description. Additionally, management should establish a timely process to review, update, and remove access privileges associated with any party when appropriate. The lack of such a process may result in unauthorized or inappropriate activity. Failure to remove access privileges when appropriate, particularly for those individuals with high levels of privilege, represents significant risk. 

The institution should protect the confidentiality of information about its customers and organization by having new hires sign agreements covering confidentiality, nondisclosure, and authorized use as a condition of their employment. Employment agreements set both the expectations and limits associated with the staff member’s functions. Management should obtain signed confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before granting new staff members, contractors, and temporary staff access to IT systems. In addition, management should require periodic acknowledgement of acceptable use policies for the network, software applications, Internet, e-mail, confidential data, and social media. Information security awareness and training programs help support information security and other management policies. 

### III.C.3 Information Security 

Financial institutions are critically dependent on their information and technology assets— hardware, software, and data. Management should protect information and technology assets to ensure operational continuity, financial viability, and the trust of customers. The unauthorized loss, destruction, or disclosure of confidential information can adversely affect a financial institution’s reputation, earnings, and capital. 

The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, management, and maintenance of the institution’s information security program. This oversight includes assigning specific responsibility and accountability for the program’s implementation and reviewing reports from management. The board should provide management with guidance, review the effectiveness of management’s actions, and annually approval written information security policies and a written information security program. Key elements that should be addressed in the information security program include the following: 

19 Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits, without the prior written consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a person convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust or money laundering (covered offenses), or who has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program in connection with a prosecution for such offense, from becoming or continuing as an institution-affiliated party, owning or controlling, directly or indirectly an insured depository institution (insured institution), or otherwise participating, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the insured institution, See 12 U.S.C. 1829. 

* • Central oversight and coordination.
* • Areas of responsibility.
* • Risk measurement.
* • Implementation of controls.
* • Monitoring and testing of effectiveness of controls.
* • Reporting.
* • Acceptable residual risk.

The information security program should be coordinated across the institution. To ensure the effectiveness of the information security program throughout the institution, management should have a process to hold staff accountable for complying with the information security program. Institution management should perform the following: 

* • Develop and implement processes to identify and protect against security events and
* • Develop, implement, and periodically test incident response procedures, which should
* • Develop and implement a threat intelligence and collaboration process to identify and
* • Consider information security risks when developing, implementing, or updating products.
* • Ensure that products are developed or updated in accordance with established information
* • Perform penetration tests before launching or making significant changes to critical systems,
* • Conduct initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring to fully understand the types of
* • Implement a governance process to establish, monitor, maintain, and test controls to mitigate
* • Develop a policy for escalating and reporting security incidents to the board, government incidents. address escalation, remediation, and reporting of events and incidents. respond to information on threats and vulnerabilities. security policies and procedures. including Internet- and client-facing applications. Management should review all findings and develop processes to ensure the timely remediation of issues identified by the tests. connections and mitigating controls in place between the financial institution and its third- party providers. In conjunction with this, management should require by contract that the third-party providers notify the institution of the use of any subcontractors or changes to subcontractor relationships.20 interconnectivity risk. agencies, law enforcement, and the institution’s primary federal and state regulator based on thresholds defined by the financial institution and applicable legal requirements. Relevant thresholds could include significant financial impact, significant operational downtime, operational or system breach, or loss of critical infrastructure.

Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Information Security” booklet for more information. 

20 Refer to the FFIEC IT Handbook’s “Outsourcing Technology Services” booklet. 

### III.C.3(a) Protecting Sensitive Customer Information 

The Information Security Standards require management to develop, and the board to approve, an information security program to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information. This program may be a component of the institution’s overall information security program. 

The institution should protect customer information from threats to security or integrity. The institution should also protect customer information from unauthorized access or use that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The board should also annually review a written report, prepared by management, regarding the financial institution’s actions toward GLBA compliance. 

### III.C.3(b) Cybersecurity 

Institutions should take a comprehensive approach to maintain the security and resilience of their IT infrastructure, including the establishment of cybersecurity controls. Although an institution is not required to have a separate cybersecurity policy or program, its information security program should identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report on the heightened risks associated with cybersecurity. To address cybersecurity risk, the information security program should consider the following: 

* • Cyber risk management and oversight.
* • Threat intelligence and collaboration.
* • Cybersecurity controls.
* • External dependency management.
* • Cyber incident management and resilience.

Additional information on these topics is available in the FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool.21 

### III.C.4 Business Continuity 

The board should approve policies, while senior management should establish and implement policies, procedures, and responsibilities for the enterprise-wide business continuity program. The board should annually approve the institution’s business continuity program. Management should document, maintain, and test the plans and backup systems periodically to mitigate the consequences of system interruptions, natural and other disasters, and unauthorized intrusions that could result in the loss, damage, or degradation of data, systems, or services. Management should also provide to the board on an annual basis a written report on the overall status of the business continuity program and the results of testing of the plan and backup systems. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Business Continuity Planning” booklet for more information. 

21 Refer to the FFIEC Cybersecurity Assessment Tool, June 2015. Use of the Cybersecurity Assessment Tool by institutions is optional. 

### III.C.5 Software Development and Acquisition 

Management should assess and mitigate operational risks associated with the development or acquisition of software. Management should develop applicable policies that specify risk management controls for the development and acquisition of systems. Management should guide the development or acquisition of software by using a system development life cycle (SDLC) or similar methodology appropriate for the specific IT environment. The extent or use of the SDLC depends on the size and complexity of the institution and the type of development activities performed. If the institution primarily acquires software, management should verify the effective use of an SDLC by the third-party provider. 

Each phase of the SDLC should have procedures that verify the maintenance and integrity of controls before the start of the next phase. When identifying the controls to be implemented in each phase, the institution should incorporate the fundamental principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Audit should review the SDLC to ensure that appropriate controls are incorporated during development. Management should analyze the operational impact early in the process to identify any additional cost and support issues. 

Management should test new technology, systems, and products thoroughly before deployment. Testing, which should include tests of security, validates that equipment and systems function properly and produce the desired results. As part of the testing process, management should verify whether new technology systems operate effectively with other technology components, including vendor-supplied technology. Pilot programs or prototypes can be helpful in developing new technology before management accepts the technology for use on a broad scale. Management should conduct retesting periodically to help manage risk exposure on an ongoing basis. 

Institutions that outsource the development of software should have a process to review their third-party provider’s control environment, reputation, and capabilities. Institutions often employ structured acquisition methodologies similar to the SDLC when acquiring significant hardware and software products. 

Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Development and Acquisition” booklet for more information. 

### III.C.6 IT Operations 

Management should be aware of and mitigate risks associated with IT operations. The institution and its service providers may have one or more IT operations groups. The number and types vary across institutions. Common examples of IT operations are data center or computer operations, network services, distributed computing, personal or desktop computing, change management, project management, security, resource management, and contingency and resiliency planning. 

Many operations functions have significant risk factors that should be addressed through effective management and control. Rapidly evolving threats require an effective monitoring and response program to ensure that vulnerability remediation occurs in a timely manner. Ongoing business-driven changes to applications should have effective change control programs to ensure that application updates are implemented in a timely manner. The institution should have controls over systems changes, including the following: 

* • Testing, authorization, and approval.
* • Timing of implementation.
* • Post-implementation review.
* • Rollback or recovery of systems when changes are unsuccessful.

Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Operations” booklet for more information. 

### III.C.7 Insurance 

The institution may rely on insurance policies as part of a mitigation strategy. Traditional business insurance policies include coverage for errors and omissions, commercial general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability policies. Management should understand the institution’s insurance needs and the limitations of insurance coverage. These policies generally exclude, or may not include, liability for all areas of IT operations and cybersecurity. 

In establishing an insurance program, management should recognize its exposure to loss, the extent to which insurance is available to cover potential losses related to information assets and technology, and the cost of such insurance. The insurance program should be commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk of the institution. Management should weigh these factors to determine how much risk the institution assumes directly. In assessing the extent of that residual risk, the institution should analyze the potential effect of an uninsured loss on itself and any affiliates or parent companies. Management should consider seeking the help of insurance consultants, attorneys, and other professionals, as necessary, to fully identify and measure the risk. Management should also review a company’s financial condition or credit rating when deciding on an insurance company. 

Management should understand that it cannot insure against all risks. Insurance complements, but does not replace, an effective system of controls. Thus, an overall appraisal of the control environment is important in assessing the adequacy of the insurance program. 

Management can insure against risks covered in standard insurance policies. Insurance that covers physical disasters often specifically excludes computer hardware and software. To the extent that policies cover physical storage media, they generally omit the extra cost of reconstructing the recorded information found on the media. Management should clearly understand what is covered and document any gaps in coverage. 

Before purchasing insurance, management should assess the costs of obtaining insurance. Estimates of these costs enable management to choose the types and amounts of insurance to carry. These estimates also allow management to determine to what extent the institution may choose to self-insure against certain losses. 

Insurance policies provide a variety of coverage for events that could affect an institution’s IT. The policies can be adapted to a particular institution’s IT environment. The evolving threat environment is contributing to increasing interest in and purchase of insurance related to cyber risks. Insurance companies can provide coverage for items including the cost of conducting an investigation into a breach, notifying customers, reputational and crisis management, business interruption, credit monitoring for affected customers, and legal costs. Management should exercise appropriate due diligence in the review of such policies, including policy exclusions to ensure the coverage aligns with management’s goals. 

As part of the decision to purchase insurance, management should consider the institution’s size and complexity and the level and efficacy of controls in place to mitigate risk. Types of insurance may include the following: 

* • IT equipment and facilities: Damage to the information assets and technology throughout the institution. Coverage should include leased equipment if the lessee is responsible for hazard coverage.
* • Media reconstruction: Damage to IT media, such as magnetic tape and disks, if the institution owns and is liable for the media. Insurance is available for on-premises, off-premises, or in-transit situations. Insurance should cover the actual replacement and reproduction cost of the media or, if reproduction is not possible, the value of the media. Additional considerations to determine the amount of coverage should include programming costs and backup expense.
* • Extra expense: The extra costs of continuing operations following damage or destruction to the institution’s physical location.
* • E-banking activities: Loss or liability arising from electronic banking activities such as Internet banking, bill payment services, and mobile financial services.
* • Business interruption: Reimbursement for monetary losses resulting from suspension of operations because of the loss, damage, or degradation of data, systems, or services.
* • Valuable papers and records: Cost to restore or replace papers and records (not defined as media) in case of direct physical loss or damage.
* • Errors and omissions: Protection against claims arising from negligent acts, errors, or omissions that occur in performing IT services for others. These policies can contain the following exclusions: 
	+ • Employee dishonesty.
	+ • Libel, slander, or defamation of character.
	+ • Liability of others assumed by the insured under contract or agreement.
	+ • Liability of loss or damage to property of others.
	+ • Personal or bodily injury or sickness.
	+ • Liability arising out of advice from third parties on methods, procedures, and practices, etc.
	+ • Liability for preparation of income tax returns.
	+ • Loss caused intentionally by, or at the direction of, the insured.

Once management has acquired appropriate insurance coverage, it customarily establishes procedures to review and ensure the adequacy of the coverage. These procedures should include an annual program review by the board of directors. 

### III.C.8 Third-Party Management 

## Action Summary 

As part of a financial institution’s third-party management program, management should ensure that third-party providers effectively provide support by doing the following: 

* • Negotiating clear and comprehensive contracts with appropriate terms that meet the institution’s requirements.
* • Ensuring receipt of audited financial statements from third-party providers at least annually.
* • Reviewing results of independent audits of IT controls at third-party providers.
* • Monitoring the responsiveness of third-party provider’s customer service, including client user group support.

Financial institutions increasingly rely on third-party providers and software vendors. Larger or more complex institutions are more likely to have institution-wide third-party management programs that encompass all of these relationships. IT departments can contract with third-party providers for several services, including data processing, software development, equipment maintenance, business continuity, data storage, Internet access, and security management. In smaller or less complex institutions with less formal third-party management programs, the procurement of third-party services should be reviewed by institution staff familiar with the operational, financial, security, and compliance requirements for such relationships. The oversight of the relationship should be performed by staff with knowledge of the services provided. 

The board of directors should hold senior management responsible for ensuring appropriate oversight of third-party relationships. Technology needed to support business objectives is often a critical factor in deciding to outsource. Managing such relationships is not just a technology issue; it is an enterprise-wide governance issue. An effective third-party management program should provide the framework for management to identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risks associated with the use of third-party providers. Management should develop and implement enterprise-wide policies and procedures to govern the third-party management program, including establishing objectives and strategies, selecting a provider, negotiating the contract, and monitoring the outsourced relationship. 

Management should evaluate the quality of service, control environment, and financial condition of the third parties providing the institution with critical IT services. Third parties can include financial institution affiliates, other financial institutions, and third-party service providers. As appropriate, these third parties should support the responsibilities of their financial institution clients to adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance. Financial institution management should expect third-party support at a level consistent with the criticality of the services provided to the institution. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Outsourcing Technology Services” booklet for more information. 

When financial institution management contracts with third-party providers for some or all IT services, it should ensure that controls over outsourced activities provide the institution with the same level of assurance as controls over those activities performed in-house. Management should also consider additional oversight or controls over third-party providers that operate in foreign locations. Management should have mitigation strategies that address risks related to foreign-based third-party providers, if applicable. In the event that the financial institution locates any of its own operations offshore and develops third-party relationships at those locations, specific risk mitigation plans should be considered to address related foreign-based third-party risks. 

Management should address exposures from third-party risks through an effective third-party management program. Some factors that management should consider or address include the following: 

* • Assessing whether each third-party relationship supports the institution’s overall objectives and strategic plans.
* • Evaluating prospective third-party providers based on the scope and importance of the services they provide.
* • Tailoring the institution’s third-party management program based on an initial and ongoing risk assessment of the institution’s third parties and the services they provide.

The time and resources devoted to managing third-party relationships effectively depend on several factors, such as the critical nature of outsourced processes, staff knowledge, and complexity of systems. Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Outsourcing Technology Services” booklet for more information. Additionally, some agencies have specific guidance on third-party relationships and managing third-party relationship risk.22 

Refer to the IT Handbook’s “Audit” booklet for more information on independent reviews of third-party providers and to the “Business Continuity Planning” booklet, appendix J, “Strengthening the Resilience of Outsourced Technology Services,” for guidance focusing on cyber resilience.

### III.D Monitoring and Reporting 

## Action Summary 

Financial institution management should ensure satisfactory monitoring and reporting of IT activities and risk. These practices should include the following: 

* • Developing metrics to measure performance, efficiency, and compliance with policy.
* • Developing benchmarks for reviewing performance.
* • Establishing and reviewing service level agreements (SLA) with critical third-party providers.
* • Developing, implementing, and monitoring a process to measure IT compliance with established policies, standards, and practices.
* • Evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and controls.
* • Implementing a quality control or quality assurance program to monitor and test systems and applications.
* • Implementing timely and effective reporting processes.

Risk monitoring provides information about the effectiveness of risk mitigation activity and should address changing threat conditions in both the financial industry and in organizations that use similar technology. Risk monitoring is ongoing within the lines of business and should include reviews of metrics (e.g., threat intelligence), performance benchmarks, SLAs, and compliance with internal policies. In addition, as part of the monitoring process, institution management should review the effectiveness of controls and ensure that quality assurance and control practices are appropriately included. Management should ensure that there is clear assignment of responsibilities and accountability for both monitoring and escalation procedures. Management should also develop an IT risk reporting process that includes defined reporting channels to ensure accurate, timely, and relevant reporting to appropriate levels of management. 

### III.D.1 Metrics 

Metrics aid management in its ability to assess the overall IT environment. The specific metrics reported, and the frequency with which they are reported, depend on the institution’s IT environment. The following are common examples: 

* • Number of risk issues identified for IT activities (updated regularly to reflect new or mitigated issues). This may include information gathered through the threat intelligence and collaboration process.
* • Number of risk acceptance issues approved by senior management. This information may be maintained in a database or other repository of the descriptions, mitigation options, and documentation of management acceptance.
* • Number of current and historical events or issues (external and internal events that deviate from the control standards).
* • Number of current or outstanding (i.e., unresolved) issues identified by the business unit, internal audit, external audit, or regulator.

Many tools can be used to provide management with metrics to facilitate risk monitoring, such as key risk indicators23 and key control indicators.24 These are indicators that correlate with changes in risk and control effectiveness. When developed and monitored correctly, metrics can direct management’s attention to areas of potential problems.25 As appropriate, certain metrics or summary reports of metrics should be provided to the board. 

### III.D.2 Performance Benchmarks 

Management should periodically review the institution’s IT functions and determine whether plans, goals, and expectations are on target. Given the cost of and business reliance on IT functions, failure to perform such monitoring could put an institution at risk. Management should establish performance benchmarks or standards for IT functions and monitor them on a regular basis. Such monitoring can provide assurance that IT functions are meeting the defined benchmarks and can identify potential problem areas. Areas to consider include mainframe and network availability, data center availability, system reruns,26 out-of-balance conditions, response time, error rates, data entry volumes, special requests, and problem reports. Management should evaluate outsourced relationships by measuring performance against SLAs. 

### III.D.3 Service Level Agreements 

The institution should establish formal SLAs with its IT providers, including affiliates and third- party providers. Larger or more complex institutions should consider establishing SLAs for internally provided services, for example, by another division or department of the same institution. SLAs establish mutual expectations and provide a baseline for measuring IT performance. Management can tie SLAs to incentive and penalty actions. SLAs should be comprehensive to provide the institution with a high level of comfort in setting expectations. The use of performance benchmarks and outcome-based measurements could identify potential issues with attaining expectations set in the SLAs. 

### III.D.4 Policy Compliance 

Management should develop, implement, and monitor a process to measure IT compliance with the institution’s established policies. In addition to the traditional reliance on internal and third- party audit functions, the institution should perform periodic self-assessments. The scope and frequency of self-assessments depend on the scale and historical performance of the IT function. Self-assessments provide management with an understanding of whether the institution is in compliance with the policies approved by the board. 

23 A key risk indicator is a measure used to indicate the level of risk associated with an activity. 

24 A key control indicator is a metric that indicates the potential for a control to fail within an organization. 

25 Refer to the “Metrics” section of the IT Handbook’s “Information Security” booklet for more information. 

26 A system rerun is a method of correcting an error that occurs during processing. An entire job or selection of jobs may have to be rerun to correct the error. 

### III.D.5 Effectiveness of Controls 

Control testing should include the effectiveness of control design and implementation and take into account the changing nature of the threats and the enforcement of control functions. Management should monitor risk mitigation activities and controls to ensure that identified risks are appropriately mitigated. Monitoring of the effectiveness of controls should be ongoing, and departments should provide periodic progress reports to management. Ongoing monitoring ensures that the risk management process is not a one-time or annual event. 

### III.D.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

Quality assurance (QA) is a process intended to ensure that a product or service under development meets specified requirements. Management should oversee the establishment of a QA process and update future planning with the results. QA may include internal performance measures, focus groups, and customer surveys. Management should assess whether QA testing is conducted on new or updated systems before implementation. Testing should be independent of any programming function and should incorporate user acceptance testing programs. The thorough QA testing of a new system can identify vulnerabilities or poor functionality. 

Quality control (QC) is a procedure intended to ensure that a product or application adheres to a defined set of quality criteria that meet the requirements of the end user. QC includes activities that can be used to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities in work products and to avoid the resource drain and expense of repeating a task. The traditional goal of QC activities is to ensure that a product conforms to specifications and is fit to use. QC helps to determine the following about a product: 

* • Whether the product works.
* • Whether the product does what it is designed to do.
* • Whether the product is fit for use.

QA and QC reports are valuable tools for management and help document the control process for the production environment. 

### III.D.7 Reporting 

Management should develop an IT risk reporting process that assembles and reports IT risk information in a manner that is timely, complete, transparent, and relevant to management decisions. IT management should provide periodic reports based on risk to senior management or the board as well as to necessary stakeholders. Recipients of IT risk reports should have the authority and responsibility to act on the reported information, provide a credible challenge for information contained in the reports, and be held accountable for the outcomes. The reporting should be appropriate to the decisions the individual reviewing the report is responsible for influencing. This reporting should be defined in accordance with the institution’s enterprise-wide risk management program. Additionally, reporting should trigger appropriate, timely, and reliable escalation procedures. 

# Appendix A: Examination Procedures 

## Examination Objective 

Examiners should use these procedures to determine the quality and effectiveness of the institution’s management of IT. Examiners should also use these procedures to measure the adequacy of the institution’s ITRM process, including management awareness and participation, risk assessment, policies and procedures, reporting, ongoing monitoring, and follow-up. 

These examination procedures (also known as the work program) are intended to assist examiners in determining the effectiveness of the institution’s IT management process. Examiners may choose, however, to use only particular work steps of the following examination procedures based on the size, complexity, and nature of the institution’s business. Examiners should use these procedures to measure the adequacy of the institution’s cybersecurity risk management processes.
